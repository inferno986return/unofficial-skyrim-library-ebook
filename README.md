# unofficial-skyrim-library-ebook
An unofficial e-book for Skyrim's vast array of texts. Happy 11<sup>th</sup> anniversary to Skyrim!

This project's goal is to provide a complete and beautiful reading experience for Skyrim's impressive selection of books in one anthology.

The goal isn't to present the books verbatim as we have wikis for that. Instead to reformat the books, correcting any typos and using standardised punctuation.

In addition, this will be my chance to try making a fully standards-compliant EPUB 3.2 book!
