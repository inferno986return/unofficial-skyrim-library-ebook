   <p class="noindent top"><img src="images/illuminated_letters/s_letter.png" height="70px" width="70px" alt="S"/>o you wish to summon the Dark Brotherhood? You wish to see someone dead? Pray, child. Pray, and let the Night Mother hear your plea.</p>
      <p>You must perform that most profane of rituals – the Black Sacrament.</p>
      <p>Create an effigy of the intended victim, assembled from actual body parts, including a heart, skull, bones and flesh. Encircle that effigy with candles.</p>
      <p>The ritual itself must then commence. Proceed to stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger rubbed with the petals of a Nightshade plant, while whispering this plea:</p>

      <p class="top"><i>“Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear. ”</i></p>

      <p class="top">Then wait, child, for the Dread Father Sithis rewards the patient. You will be visited by a representative of the Dark Brotherhood. So begins a contract bound in blood.</p>
